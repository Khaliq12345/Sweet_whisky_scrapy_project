# Sweet_whisky_scrapy_project

In this post we are going to scrape an ecommerce website. We’ll get into each individual product page and retrieve our information from there. 
This is the website we are going to scrape – it’s an online shop that sells whisky.

In this scrapy project we are going to scrap the product name, product price as well as the product image.
